## Testing Workflow

### Phase 1: Baseline Testing (Today)
**Goal**: Identify what works and what's broken on each platform

1. **Open both platforms side-by-side**:
   - Desktop: Web app in browser (http://localhost:5025)
   - Emulator: Mobile app in Expo Go
   - iPhone: Mobile app in Expo Go (when ready)

2. **Test each feature on BOTH platforms**:
   - Navigate to feature on web
   - Navigate to same feature on mobile
   - Compare functionality
   - Document differences in testing dashboard

3. **Mark test results**:
   - **Pass** ✅: Works perfectly on BOTH platforms
   - **Fail** ❌: Broken on one or both platforms
   - **Needs Work** ⚠️: Works but different behavior between platforms
   - **Not Tested** ⏳: Haven't tested yet

### Phase 2: Feature Parity Analysis
**Goal**: Identify what features are missing on each platform

1. **Web-only features** (missing on mobile):
   - List them
   - Decide: Should mobile have it?
   - If yes, add to mobile backlog

2. **Mobile-only features** (missing on web):
   - List them
   - Decide: Should web have it?
   - If yes, add to web backlog

3. **Different implementations**:
   - List features that work differently
   - Decide: Which approach is better?
   - Standardize on the better approach

### Phase 3: Fix & Implement
**Goal**: Fix broken features and implement missing ones

1. **Fix broken features** (highest priority):
   - Start with features that are completely broken
   - Fix on both platforms
   - Re-test to confirm

2. **Implement missing features**:
   - Start with core features (shopping, pantry, recipes)
   - Add to platform that's missing it
   - Test on both platforms

3. **Standardize implementations**:
   - Align behavior between platforms
   - Ensure consistent UX
   - Test thoroughly

### Phase 4: Offline Support
**Goal**: Ensure mobile app works offline

1. **Test offline mode** (mobile only):
   - Shopping list ✅ (already implemented)
   - Pantry (needs implementation)
   - Favorites (needs implementation)
   - Cached recipes (needs implementation)

2. **Implement sync**:
   - Background sync when online
   - Conflict resolution
   - Sync status indicators
